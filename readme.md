# Jext Project - JukeboxExtended

A [Spigot](https://www.spigotmc.org/) plugin that allows server to add custom music disc without removing the originals throught the power of resource pack and Spigot API! Get the plugin artifact at the resource page over [here](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/jukebox-extended.76963/).

Read the [Wiki page](https://github.com/Tajam/jext-spigot-plugin/wiki) for more details and guides.

## Dependencies

### Required

[ProtocolLib](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/protocollib.1997/) to make jukebox play custom music disc like vanilla.

### Optional

In future, Jext will support regional music loops with [WorldGuard API](https://dev.bukkit.org/projects/worldguard).
