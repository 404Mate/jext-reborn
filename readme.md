# Jext Reborn Project - JukeboxExtendedReborn

## gh-pages branch

In this branch I develop the website to automatically create a resource pack and configure the plugin

## What's this?

A [Spigot](https://www.spigotmc.org/) plugin that allows server to add custom music disc without removing the originals through the power of a resource pack and the Spigot API!

Read the [Wiki page](https://github.com/spartacus04/jext-reborn/wiki) for more details and guides.

## Dependencies

[ProtocolLib](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/protocollib.1997/) to make jukebox play custom music disc like vanilla.

## Core features

- Adding and playing custom music disc without replacing the original music disc.
- Customizable disc title, author and lore texts.
- Allow/Disallow custom discs drop from Creepers.
- Supports custom model data, allow customized disc texture.
- Auto kick players who rejected the server resource pack.
- Parrot will still dance to the music!
